Hi !

I am a highly motivated person looking to solve challenging real-world problems in a data-driven manner. I want to be in a place working with cutting-edge tools alongside a talented set of people in a high-growth environment. Having worked as a Business Analyst, Data Scientist, and Consulting Analyst across companies like Bain & Co., Deloitte, and Ernst & Young for clients in different industries, I bring a diverse skill set of developing ML models, writing Python/SQL scripts for data wrangling, building ETL pipelines, using Databricks/Spark for handling big-data, creating tableau dashboards for presenting business insights, performing statistical tests, to name a few. I like to build optimized yet simple and scalable solutions for our customers using emerging AI tools. Always excited to work on roles that perfectly blends my past experience, current academic projects, and my zeal to be at the forefront of data, business, and technology.
